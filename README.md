# Data-Analytics-Final-Dashboard
This consist of the excel files assigned by the lecturer and also how my team and I further analyse the trends and relationship of the households and verdict out outcomes.
You can view these files by clicking on data merging.tlfx to run the output first before going to the tableau to add in connector (.hyper) 
This was completed in Year 1 Sem 2 under the module of Data Analytics and Visualisation ( with my teammates, Low Gin Lim, Yap Suen Hong, Cecila Chew Yoke Ching)
